##Resources
###jQuery Plugins
* [SlickNav](http://slicknav.com/) SlickNav was the first jQuery plugin that I used on the Pizza Planet site.  It allows for the opportunity to display the navigation header in a hamburger menu to allow for easy access and usability for mobile and tablet devices.  It was very easy to install, and I would absolutely use it again on future projects.  This can be seen in the upper right hand corner on any device that has a screen width of 1100px or less.  Once the browser width exceeds 1100px, a standard link navigation menu appears underneath the logo.  Both navigations are represented in red for easy resemblance.
* [Slippry](http://slippry.com/) Slippry was the second jQuery plugin that was used on this site.  This plugin can be viewed on the index page as the image slider located right below the header.  It was very easy to install although as mentioned in my comments below every so often the console will throw an error for the code that I wrote in my main.js file.

###JavaScript Code
* Two separate JavaScript event listeners were written for this site to add content, and both can be found on the menu page. This first is an event listener that listens for a click on the header "Pizza Planet Menu", and once clicked by the user displays the special dish of the day that can be ordered.  This is typically a special rendition of a dish found on the menu. The second add event listener was used on the menu images.  When the user clicks on an image the description of that food item is displayed. (These were created using class notes)

##jQuery Code
* Custom jQuery code was added to the index page to create interactivity.  When the user hovers over the "Welcome to Pizza Planet" header, new text appears and the color is changed.  Immediately after a 'hover exit' the old text is replaced. (This was created using class notes)

##Other Resources
* The images throughout the site were taken from various google image searches, non of the images are my own.
* The image of the outside of Pizza Planet was taken from [Dad's Guide to WDW](http://www.dadsguidetowdw.com/toy-story-pizza-planet.html).  The photo of the inside was used from [Lajollamom.com](http://lajollamom.com/disneyland-park-paris/).  The image of the child having a birthday party with the events link was taken from [thefunjunction.com](http://www.thefunjunction.com/public/birthdays/packages/index.cfm).  The image of the pizza over the menu button, as well as the image of it on the menu page was used from [Disney Tourist Blog](http://www.disneytouristblog.com/pizza-planet-review/).  I was unable to relocate the image of the people playing arcade games. The trip advisor award image was used from [Trip Advisor](http://blog.tripadvisor.com/2016/02/11/announcing-the-2016-travelers-choice-favorites-awards-in-canada/).
*  A majority of the menu item pictures and their descriptions were used from [Chuck E. Cheese's](http://www.chuckecheese.com/menu) menu website. The banner image on the menu page was take from [wdwlive.com](http://www.wdwlive.com/picture/disney-studios/streets-of-america/pizza-planet-1170-4.html).
* On the events page, the picture in the birthday section was used from [Galaxy-Zone](http://galaxy-zone.com/birthdays/). The picture of the child eating pizza was used from [Discovery.com](http://news.discovery.com/human/health/pizza-prescription-kids-should-eat-less-say-researchers-150119.htm). The skee-ball photo was used from [Saturn5](http://www.saturn5.biz/). The tokens picture was used from [Arcadecontrols.com](http://arcadecontrols.com/arcadehistory.php?WhichDate=03/2006). The disco ball photo was used from [JSTOR Daily](http://daily.jstor.org/hustle-disco-marketed/). And finally the Buzz and Woody photo was used from [Kennythepirate.com](http://www.kennythepirate.com/2014/07/20/maneuvering-hollywood-studios-extra-magic-hour-day-with-frozen-summer-of-fun-activities/dsc_0093/).
* I tried to remember to save the website links as I saved the photos, but I do not remember where I found the arcade image from, it was from a google search I had preformed on arcade games, I tried to do a reverse google search of the image but came up empty handed.
* The social media icons were created in PhotoShop using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

##Comments
* This was a fun, final project and it was great to see all of the elements of the style tile be put to use.  This project reminded me of how much floats are annoying and in the beginning I had a very difficult time getting anything below the header to show properly.
* The Slippry jQuery plugin, in my console every so often it will throw an error that the .slippry is not a function in my main javascript file, not all the time but sometimes.
* My first add event listener for the image click in the menu page, in the main JavaScript file as well sometimes the first one throws an error saying null, again not all the time but sometimes.  I have been unable to figure out why, even though you explained it to me I am not able to understand why it is showing null.
* I think I got lost again when it came to commits, some are detailed others have broader edit saves.
* I like the mobile version better, and this project showed me how I like to design for a mobile versions over a desktop visual in the future.
* Not thrilled with my layout for the index page, I thought it needed more content than just header slider image and then image and button links but I couldn't think of what else to fill the space.
* I had a very hard time with the circle images and spacing margin-top.  This is a lot of space between them on the index page and the menu page.
* Lastly, I like that I will now be able to look through jQuery, and JavaScript code to be able to distinguish what exactly it entails as well as be able to successfully fork projects off of GitHub.
